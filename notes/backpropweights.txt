in propagate, filter plane i of filter f convolves with plane i from each input cube
to contribute to plane f of each output

so, for backprop:
need to take plane i from each input cube, and plane f from each output cube, 
and convolve together to get changes to plane i of filter f
so, using notation:
  I[n] is input cube n
  O[n] is output cube n
  I[n,i] is plane i of input cube n
  O[n,f] is plane f of output cube n
  F[f] is filter cube f
  F[f,i] is plane i of filter cube f
  dF[f,i] is weights update to plane i of filter cube f
  (*) means convolve
  sum() means sum()
  sum[n]() means sum over n
Then:
dF[f,i] = sum[n]( I[n,i] (*) O[n,f] )

basically we have to convolve one specific plane of each output
with one specific plane of each input, to get one filter plane change
(and do this for each example, sum them together)

sizes, eg for mnist:
plane f from each output: 128 * 28 * 28 * 4 = 401KB
plane i from each input: 128 * 28 * 28 * 4 = 401KB
plane i from filter f: 5 * 5 * 4 = 100 bytes...
plane i from all filters: 5 * 5 * 4 * 8 = 800 bytes (ok :-) )
all planes from all filters eg: 5 * 5 * 4 * 8 * 1 = 800 bytes (ok :-) )
